## Ecological momentary computerized adaptive testing (EMCAT) to measure and compare recovery after hand surgery

Welcome to the EMCAT-2 repository. 

Here you will find an anonymized version of the dataset collected during our study 'Ecological Momentary Computerized Adaptive Testing (EMCAT) to measure and compare recovery after hand surgery' (EMCAT-2). Due to local information governance policies and UK data protection laws, we have removed fields from the dataset to ensure that none of our participants are reasonably likely to be identified either directly, or indirectly through singling out or data linkage. 

We have removed all demographics, site locations, clinical follow-up outcomes and time stamps from this dataset. Because of this, it will not be possible to reproduce our analyses exactly. However, this dataset can still be used to explore individual recovery trajectories, and fit similar mixed-effects models to those presented in our paper, with key findings largely preserved.

The dataset is named 'nomination_level_data.csv' and comes with the associated data dictionary. 

The R script 'Limited dataset reproduction.R' contains code to reproduce the key findings from our study, where possible, from this reduced dataset. 

The dataset is freely available under a CC BY 4.0 license. You are welcome to use it for secondary analysis, but we ask that you please cite our paper when doing so.
